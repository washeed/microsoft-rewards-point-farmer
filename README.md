# Automated Search Script with PyAutoGUI

This Python script automates searches in a search bar using the PyAutoGUI library. It is designed to perform searches with a list of words in a specified search bar location.

## Features:

- **Customizable Search Bar Location:** You can provide the XY coordinates of the search bar to interact with.

- **Randomized Sleep Time:** The script includes a randomized sleep time between searches to simulate more natural behavior and avoid potential automation detection.

- **Typing with Delay:** Each letter of the search query is typed with a specified delay, giving a more human-like typing pattern.

## Usage:

1. Install PyAutoGUI:
   ```bash
   pip install pyautogui
   ```

2. Set the XY coordinates of your search bar in the script.

3. Customize the list of words to search.

4. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python automated_search.py
   ```

5. Sit back and watch as the script automates searches with your specified keywords.

## Note:

- Be cautious while using automation tools to interact with websites. Ensure compliance with the terms of service of the websites being automated.

- Replace the placeholder search bar location with the actual coordinates and adjust the sleep time and typing delay as needed.
